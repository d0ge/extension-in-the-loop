/**
 * A managed engine for sending many HTTP requests concurrently, subject to its
 * {@link ResourcePool} (concurrency, throttling, retries). The run is visible and controllable
 * as a task on the Burp dashboard.
 *
 * <p>Obtain an instance from {@link Http#createRequestEngine()} or
 * {@link Http#createRequestEngine(RequestEngineOptions)}, then drive it one of three ways:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Eager</b> - {@link #queue(HttpRequest) queue} the requests up front, then
 *       {@link #sendAll()}.</li>
 *   <li><b>Reactive</b> - queue one or more seed requests, then {@link #sendAll(ResponseHandler)}
 *       and let the handler {@link RequestExecution#queue queue} follow-ups as responses arrive.</li>
 *   <li><b>Streaming</b> - supply a {@link #sendAll(RequestSource) source} that generates
 *       requests lazily on demand, for very large or open-ended runs.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Each {@code sendAll} overload optionally takes a per-request {@link Duration} timeout; the
 * overloads without one apply a sensible default. The send runs in the background and
 * {@code sendAll} returns immediately with a {@link RequestExecution} handle - so a long-running
 * send never blocks the caller. Each queued request may carry a correlation
 * {@link #queue(HttpRequest, String) label} echoed back on its {@link RequestResult}.
 *
 * <p>An engine is <strong>single-use</strong>: exactly one {@code sendAll} call starts its one
 * run. Any further {@code sendAll} call (of any overload) throws {@link IllegalStateException};
 * create a new engine for another run.
