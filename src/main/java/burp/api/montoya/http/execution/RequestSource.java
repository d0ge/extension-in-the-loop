 * on demand - only when it has capacity to send it - so requests are <strong>generated
 * lazily</strong> and only a bounded number are ever held in memory at once, regardless of
 * the total count. This is what lets a run cover an arbitrarily large (even unbounded)
 * number of requests without materialising them all up front.
 *
 * <p>{@link #next()} is called serially by the engine (never concurrently), so a stateful
 * source needs no synchronisation. Pair this with a {@link ResponseHandler} that returns
 * {@link Retention#DROP} for the uninteresting responses to keep the result set bounded too.
